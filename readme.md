# MoneyMoney spending report

## What is it?
1. Export the transactions of your MoneyMoney account to a CSV file.
2. Import the csv into this app and get a report (console, csv) of your average spendings per month by category and year.

## Why?
I wanted to know how much I spend on average on certain categories per month. I could not find a way to do this in MoneyMoney, so I wrote this little app.
